**EttEnApp** is an iteration of a previous project called [QuickSwedishWordbook](https://github.com/tmrk/QuickSwedishWordbook) that was written in Vanilla JavaScript.

I decided to rewrite it in **ReactJS** (and using Sass), mainly in order to start experimenting with React Native deployments later on.

The idea remains the same: to provide an easy and quick way to look up Swedish words. 

Also, if the specified word is a noun, the app displays its gender (_**en**_ or _**ett**_) prominently at the top - which is something that learners of the Swedish language often find difficult to memorise.

EttEnApp is deployed on GitHub Pages: **https://tmrk.github.io/EttEnApp/**
